# Growtopia Resprite Project Launcher

GTRP Launcher is a versatile Growtopia tool that loads custom texture packs and resprites. As an all-in-one packaged tool, it can install, delete, toggle, and load custom Growtopia texture packs, as well as download community-made ones from a custom workshop.

GTRP Launcher currently only supports Windows.

Workshop resprites can be found <a href="https://github.com/sadfaceman-gt/GTRP-Launcher-Resprites" target=_blank>here</a>

> Powered by Growtopia Resprite Project - All resprites are "client-side" modifications. Modified textures will only appear on your client, and everyone else will not see the resprite, unless they also have the same resprites.
